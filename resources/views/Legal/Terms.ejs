        action procedures; and
        (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on
        behalf of the general public or any other persons.

        use; and
        (c) any claim for injunctive relief.

        If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
        Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
        shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
